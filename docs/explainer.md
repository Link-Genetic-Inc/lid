# Explainer: LinkID – Persistent, Never-Break Identifiers for the Web

**Authors**: Link Genetic GmbH
**Status**: Draft for Community Group discussion

---

## Problem

URLs are fragile. Content moves, domains expire, formats change. As a result, hyperlinks across the Web frequently break, leading to the widespread “404 Not Found” problem.
This undermines trust, accessibility, long-term preservation, and even sustainability: broken links force re-searching, duplicate storage, and wasted bandwidth.

Existing persistent identifier systems (e.g., DOI, Handle, ARK) address some of these challenges but are mostly scoped to specific domains (academic publishing, libraries). They are not widely adopted as a **general Web standard** for all resources.

---

## Goals

* Provide a **universal, Web-native identifier** that guarantees resolution even if the original resource moves or changes.
* Offer a **simple syntax** (e.g., `linkid:` scheme or HTTP-based `https://w3id.org/linkid/...`).
* Enable **resolvers** that map stable identifiers to current destinations using open, semantic, and AI-supported methods.
* Ensure compatibility with existing Web infrastructure (HTTP, DNS, browsers, archives).
* Support **sustainability claims** by quantifying avoided re-searching and duplication.

---

## Non-Goals

* Hosting or storing the actual content.
* Replacing existing persistent ID systems (DOI, ARK, Handle), but rather complementing and interlinking with them.
* Enforcing one central registry; federated/multi-stakeholder approaches are encouraged.

---

## Proposed Solution

* **Identifier Syntax**:

  * Option A: new URI scheme `linkid:<UUID or hash>`
  * Option B: HTTP namespace `https://w3id.org/linkid/<UUID>`
* **Resolver Module**:

  * Takes a `LinkID` and redirects (301/302) to the current target resource.
  * Uses semantic/AI-assisted rules to update mappings when sources move.
  * Maintains audit trails and optional CO₂-impact data.
* **Ecosystem Components**:

 * Registry with versioned mappings, available under open or commercial license.
  * Client libraries (JavaScript, Java, Python) for easy integration.
  * APIs for CMS, archives, and corporate systems.

---

## Security & Privacy Considerations

* **Data minimization**: identifiers carry no personal information.
* **Integrity**: mappings cryptographically signed to prevent tampering.
* **Abuse prevention**: resolvers must handle malicious redirects, phishing attempts, and provide safe-browsing checks.
* **Long-term trust**: governance under open standards with clear patent licensing terms.

---

## Alternatives Considered

* **Use only DOIs** – not feasible outside publishing, limited governance.
* **ARK/Handle** – strong in archival contexts but less mainstream on the Web.
* **HTTP 301 redirect chains** – brittle, often break without central stewardship.

---

## Stakeholders & Adoption

* **Browsers**: optional native resolution for `linkid:` scheme.
* **Content creators**: embed `LinkIDs` in documents, PDFs, websites.
* **Libraries & archives**: align with DOI, ARK, Handle communities.
* **Industry & governments**: ensure long-term referenceability of policies, contracts, knowledge bases.
* **Sustainability actors**: measure avoided CO₂ impact of broken links.
