## Purpose

The **LinkID Persistent Identifier** is designed to become an **open,
interoperable, and community-driven standard** for resilient hyperlinks.
Our objective is to ensure that every digital reference — whether on a
website, in a document, or in an archive — remains **valid, traceable,
and semantically resolvable** forever.
